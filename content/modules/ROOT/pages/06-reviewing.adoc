that wait time reflected in the recorded session as well.

In addition to some standard video player functionality, the buttons on
the right side of the player will allow you to zoom in and out to get
closer, or further away, look at the content. Also, the search function
located at the bottom of the player window will search the recorded
session for text and report time codes at which that string is found.
Those time codes are links, which will change the location of the
playback in the player.

Below the player is additional metadata about this session as well as
the log entries for the session.
