Navigate back over to the _Web Console_ tab in your lab environment.

If you are not already on the _Session Recording_ page, please navigate
there.

You should now see a recorded session available.

After selecting the session, you will be taken to a page with an
integrated player through which you can watch the session. Press the
_Play_ button to review the session.

The session was recorded in real-time, so if you started the `+bash+`
session but did not start running commands immediately, you will see
that wait time reflected in the recorded session as well.

In addition to some standard video player functionality, the buttons on
the right side of the player will allow you to zoom in and out to get
closer, or further away, look at the content. Also, the search function
located at the bottom of the player window will search the recorded
session for text and report time codes at which that string is found.
Those time codes are links, which will change the location of the
playback in the player.

Below the player is additional metadata about this session as well as
the log entries for the session.
