== Login to the Web Console

Now that the required software is installed, it is time to configure and
enable terminal session recording. You will use the Web Console to
perform this task.

Use the _Web Console_ tab in your lab environment to log into the Web
Console for the system. You should use the following credentials:

Username: 
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]

rhel

Password:

{bastion_ssh_password}

Now that you are logged into the Web console, and because you have
installed the *cockpit-session-recording* rpm package, you can now
select the _Session Recording_ option in the left-side navigation menu.
