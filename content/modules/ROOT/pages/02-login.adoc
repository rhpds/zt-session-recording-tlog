Now that the required software is installed, it is time to configure and
enable terminal session recording. You will use the Web Console to
perform this task.

Use the _Web Console_ tab in your lab environment to log into the Web
Console for the system. You should use the following credentials:

Username: *rhel* Password: *redhat*

____
*NOTE:* Problems accessing the Web Console or logging in? For best
results, copy and paste the URL into Google Chrome.

Next, turn on administrative access. Click on the
`+Turn on administrative access+` button.

Enter the Password `+redhat+`.

Now that you are logged into the Web console, and because you have
installed the *cockpit-session-recording* rpm package, you can now
select the _Session Recording_ option in the left-side navigation menu.
