The _Session Recording_ application is initially blank, reporting *No
recorded sessions*. Click the _gear icon_ in the upper right-hand corner
to be taken to the configuration settings for session recording.

On the resulting page, you will be offered access to configuration
information for session recording. For the purpose of this scenario, you
will accept most of the defaults and under the *SSSD Configuration*
section at the bottom of the page, select the _Scope_ of _All_, which
will apply session recording to all users and groups that open sessions
on the system.

Once you click the _Save_ button, Web Console will write out a small
configuration file detailing the scope for the sssd daemon.

After saving the configuration, return the Web Console to the main
_Session Recording_ page.
