On the resulting page, you will be offered access to configuration
information for session recording. For the purpose of this scenario, you
will accept most of the defaults and under the *SSSD Configuration*
section at the bottom of the page, select the _Scope_ of _All_, which
will apply session recording to all users and groups that open sessions
on the system.
