Switch back to the Terminal in your lab environment.

As mentioned on the previous step, the Web Console actions have written
a small configuration file for sssd,
*/etc/sssd/conf.d/sssd-session-recording.conf* You can review it to
verify that the scope has been set to *all* so that all sessions for all
users and groups will be recorded.

[source,bash,run]
----
cat /etc/sssd/conf.d/sssd-session-recording.conf
----

Changes to the other configuration options displayed by Web Console
would have stored those changes in */etc/tlog/tlog-rec-session.conf*.
For example, the *notice* message displayed to users who are having
their session recorded. You can inspect this file as well, if desired.

[source,bash,run]
----
cat /etc/tlog/tlog-rec-session.conf
----
