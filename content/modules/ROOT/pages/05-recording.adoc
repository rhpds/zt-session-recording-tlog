Change user to the *rhel* user so that the session can be recorded.

[source,bash,run]
----
su - rhel
----

You will notice that when the `+bash+` session starts, the *rhel* user
receives the notice message configured in the *tlog* configuration.

Run some commands in the *rhel* user’s session.

[source,bash,run]
----
ls /tmp
----

[source,bash,run]
----
who
----

[source,bash,run]
----
df -hP
----

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf list installed
----

Now that you have some data in a recorded session, you can log out of
the user’s terminal session.

[source,bash,run]
----
exit
----
