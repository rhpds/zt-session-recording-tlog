Change user to the *rhel* user so that the session can be recorded.

[source,bash,run,subs=attributes+]
----
su - rhel
----

You will notice that when the `+bash+` session starts, the *rhel* user
receives the notice message configured in the *tlog* configuration.

Run some commands in the *rhel* user’s session.

NOTE: You will need to copy and paste the following commands into the terminal in order for the recording to work peroperly. This is a limitation of the lab environment, not the tlog tool.

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
ls /tmp
----

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
who
----

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
df -hP
----

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
dnf list installed
----

Now that you have some data in a recorded session, you can log out of
the user’s terminal session.

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
exit
----
