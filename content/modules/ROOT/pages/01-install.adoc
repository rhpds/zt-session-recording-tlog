Session recording on Red Hat Enterprise Linux is enabled using the `tlog` package, and we will also be using the `session-recording` plugin for `cockpit`.  These are found in the following two rpm packages, *cockpit-session-recording* and *tlog*.

[source,bash,run]
----
yum install -y cockpit-session-recording tlog
----

The first package, *cockpit-session-recording* will add an additional
feature Web Console which you will be using to enable and configure
session recording. The *tlog* package will provide the tools which will
be used to both record and view the recorded terminal sessions.
